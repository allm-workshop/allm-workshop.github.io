## Submission Guidelines
Submissions should have at least 4 pages and at most 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendices.
Accepted papers will be given 1 additional content page to address reviewers' comments.
Please use the official [NeurIPS style files]() available as an [Overleaf template]() to format your papers.
Our reviewing policy is double-blind, and the submissions should be fully anonymized.
Please submit through our [Openreview submission site]().

**Dual Submission**: We also allow submissions that are under review in other venues or have preprint versions. But please make sure to follow the dual submission policies from the other venues.

**Archival vs Non-Archival**: During submission, please also indicate if you want your paper to be archival or non-archival. Archival papers, if accepted, will be included in the workshop proceeding, while non-archival will not be included. Both archival or non-archival papers, if accepted, will be presented at workshop.

**Anonymity Period**: We do not enforce an anonymity period. We allow preprint servers such as arXiv at any point of time.
